        <h2 is-upgraded>Format</h2>
<p>This workshop is presented as a hands-on tutorial and participants are encouraged to follow along and work through the exercises. Feel free to ask questions or request clarifications at any point during the workshop as it is an integral part to the experience.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>The workshop has several optional exercises and suggestions for participants interested in exploring further or branching out in different directions. These are clearly identified as being optional and are intended to spark your imagination or give you some ideas. If you try to do all optional exercises, the workshop will last well beyond the intended 3 hours.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Requirements</h2>
<p>There are only two hard requirements in order to follow along with the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 hours of your time</li>
<li>A computer with administrative privileges with the following software:  <ul>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Ghidra</li>
<li>Your favorite code editor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An interest in binary analysis and/or reverse engineering</li>
<li>An internet connection</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Download Ghidra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nsec2020.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/docker.tar.gz.zip" target="_blank">Download Docker Image</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nsec2020.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/sample.zip" target="_blank">Download Sample</a> (Password: infected)</li>
<li>Install Docker (and optionally docker-compose)</li>
<li>Make sure you have a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html" target="_blank">Java JDK</a> and the JDK&#39;s <code>bin/</code> directory on your <code>PATH</code>.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>For NorthSec 2020 Attendants</strong> If you prefer to work online, visit <a href="https://advanced-binary-analysis.gosec.co" target="_blank">https://advanced-binary-analysis.gosec.co</a> to spawn an online environment. You will still need Ghidra installed locally, and you will need to download any file that you want to keep at the end of the workshop. The online environment requires authentication with GitHub OAuth.</p>
</aside>
<p>Once everything is installed and functional, import the docker image and start an instance of the container:</p>
<pre><code>    mkdir ~/ABA &amp;&amp; cd ~/ABA
    wget https://nsec2020.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/docker.tar.gz.zip
    unzip -P &#39;eJ@SbPIqZcpY#PGZ^PqN#JuG%pF42Z2VBq1zDOUEKRJIw#h&#39; docker.tar.gz.zip &amp;&amp; rm docker.tar.gz.zip
    docker image load -i docker.tar.gz
    docker run --name aba-workshop -p8888:8888 -v$(pwd):/home/joyvan/host -it advanced-binary-analysis
</code></pre>
<p>This will spawn a persistent container instance named <code>aba-workshop</code> and map your current directory to the container at <code>/host</code> so that you can easily share files. You can then navigate to <code>http://localhost:8888</code> using the access token from your terminal to access the lab environment.</p>
<p>After the workshop, you can remove the docker container with the following code if you want to keep your system clean:</p>
<pre><code>    docker stop aba-workshop
    docker rm aba-workshop
    docker rmi advanced-binary-analysis
</code></pre>
<p>We&#39;re all set! Ready? Let&#39;s go!</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Initial Analysis" duration="10">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>In this step, you will perform initial reconaissance work on the sample and get a sense for what it does, and how to approach its analysis. You will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a Ghidra Project</li>
<li>Performing Automatic Analysis in Ghidra</li>
<li>Identifying Functions of Interest</li>
<li>Identifying Obfuscation</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Retrieving the Sample</h2>
<p>Start by downloading the sample if you haven&#39;t already. The zip file is protected with the password &#34;infected&#34;, which is common to prevent anti-virus software from removing your samples. The file is not actually malicious, and we won&#39;t be executing the sample in this workshop.</p>
<pre><code>wget https://nsec2020.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/sample.zip
unzip -P infected sample.zip
</code></pre>
<p>Normally after acquiring an unknown sample, it&#39;s a good idea to run a bit of initial reconaissance against it to get a sense for what it is.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>file</code> on the sample to determine what type of file it is</li>
<li>Use <code>strings</code> to list the strings inside the file. Anything interesting?</li>
<li>Use <code>binwalk</code> to check whether there are embedded files in the image.</li>

<h2 is-upgraded>Taking a Deeper Look with Ghidra</h2>
<p>Launch Ghidra and create a new project in the directory of your choice, giving it a descriptive name.</p>
<p>Import the binary using the <code>I</code> shortcut or navigate to <strong>File &gt; Import File...</strong></p>
<p>After the binary is imported, Ghidra gives you a summary of the binary&#39;s metadata. This information gives you a quick overview of whether Ghidra has successfully resolved imports or not.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Successful file import dialog" src="img/57b0ac20ddaa444f.png"></p>
<p>Ghidra projects consist of one or more binary files which make up a single logical reverse engineering task. Having auxiliary binary files such as additional shared objects, unpacked files, and other binary blobs in the same project makes it possible to cross-reference them and keep everything in one tidy spot.</p>
<p>You can launch the Code Browser tool by <strong>double clicking</strong> on a given file in the project window.</p>
<p>Do so now on the freshly imported <code>aba</code> file.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Automated Analysis</h2>
<p>When the Code Browser loads a new file, it will offer to perform automated analysis on it. For small binaries, this is usually a good option and deploying the full strength of Ghidra&#39;s analysis suite in these cases can greatly enhance the quality of information and facilitate the process of reverse engineering.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Automatic analysis prompt" src="img/83b5f41ef4c4896e.png"></p>
<p>In the case of larger binary files, analyses can become resource intensive and time consuming, making it necessary to selectively run analyses as needed.</p>
<p>In this lab, however, it is safe to run all analyses. If you selected <strong>No</strong> at the automated analysis prompt, it is always possible to re-run any analysis manually by going to the Code Browser&#39;s <strong>Analysis &gt; Auto-Analyze ‘</strong>... menu entry (shortcut: <code>A</code>)</p>
<p>After analysis, Ghidra will have identified and annotated a lot of data for you, such as function starts, cross-references across functions, data references, and more.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>It is important to understand that these analyses <em>are not perfect</em> and that malware authors are aware of them, and often try to break or alter the results to make their program&#39;s intent less obvious and make the analyst&#39;s (your) job harder.</p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Analysis configuration menu" src="img/1663b35f5bdcdf4c.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the various Code Browser panels and listings before and after automated-analysis, what&#39;s different?</li>
<li>Read through the list of program analyses provided by Ghidra (shortcut: <code>A</code>)</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identify Interesting Bits</h2>
<p>The most difficult part of any reverse engineering effort is almost always determining which parts of the program are worth looking at and which parts are endless time sinks. It is important to have both a very narrow view of the program internals when focusing on specific functions, and to simultaneously keep a high-level view of the overall structure (&#34;the big picture&#34;) of the program otherwise it is easy to go in circles without making any significant progress.</p>
<p>While this is not an exhaustive list, it helps to follow these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a specific goal (e.g. Defeat the anti-debugging routine, find the sandbox checks, etc.)</li>
<li>Identify elements relevant to that goal</li>
<li>Have a structured and incremental program annotation process</li>
<li>Review and re-evaluate your knowledge frequently</li>
<li>Revalidate your assumptions periodically throughout the effort</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now walk through several sources of information that can help with answering the &#34;Where do I start?&#34; question that often comes after a goal has been established.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORT ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the imported functions by <code>aba</code>. Imports are a great source of information on potential program behavior, since library functions are referenced by name and the library must be referenced somehow in the program. We use Ghidra&#39;s Functions view (<strong>Window &gt; Functions</strong>) and enable the <strong>Mem Block</strong> column by right-clicking on any column header and selecting <strong>Add/Remove Columns...</strong>. Next, we can filter by <code>.plt</code> to get only imported functions. PLT stands for Procedure Linkage Table and can be thought of as an import table for functions that are implemented in external libraries.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>A lot of malware will make it more difficult to identify their behavior by statically linking libraries and obfuscating library calls, or by hashing symbol names and using roundabout ways such as memory scanning to make cross-referencing with static tools more difficult.</p>
</aside>
<iframe class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72vQAYpVsK0?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>When reviewing imports, knowledge of common libraries and frequently used third party libraries is important to get a quick idea of what the sample&#39;s capabilities are. It helps to group the imports by logical purpose.</p>
<p>For instance, <code>dl</code> functions are used to manage dynamic libraries at runtime, resolve functions from those libraries.</p>
<p>Memory management functions such as <code>memalign</code> and <code>mprotect</code> are commonly used to allocate memory and mark it as executable, to turn data into code or execute shellcode.</p>
<p>These APIs are interesting because they are the boundary between a program and the operating system facilities, and with the exception of bare system calls, are ultimately unavoidable.</p>
<p>Once an interesting import is identified, finding where it is called from is a very efficient method for identifying interesting functions in the program under analysis. Ghidra&#39;s analysis will compute as many cross-references as possible, but it can and will miss dynamically computed references.</p>
<p><strong>ENTROPY</strong> Entropy is the indication of how random data is in a given block of data. The higher the entropy, the more unrelated the data in the given block is. Compression and encryption, by their very nature, yield data with very high entropy, whereas code and data have structure and repetition to them, yielding much lower entropy.</p>
<p>Because compression and encryption are often used to hide data or code from curious people, identifying high entropy data and its cross-references is a good method to determine whether a sample is packed.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ghidra’s Entropy Annotation" src="img/7acf24d71f1fe292.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>OPTIONAL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Play with the Code Browser&#39;s cross-reference to find calls to various imports.</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p><strong>DATA XREF</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, debug strings or convenience functions (one big example being enumeration value to string conversion routines) will help you identify the functions you are looking for. In some real world samples, the debug strings left in the binary includes as much as all function tracing code, making symbol recovery extremely easy.</p>
<p>Using this method relies on Ghidra&#39;s <strong>Search &gt; For strings...</strong> to identify relevant or interesting strings, then following the data cross-references to find the functions which make use of the data. This works only when the data references are static and not computed at runtime.</p>
<p><strong>FUNCTION BROWSING</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, when the sample doesn&#39;t have too many identified functions, a more manual approach is to skim through each function and looking at the control-flow and decompilation output to get a sense for what the functions are doing.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>This technique does not scale very well with program size and will not yield amazing results most of the time, but it can help identify potentially interesting or suspicious functions that are worth further investigation.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>A Word on Dynamic Analysis</h2>
<p>People who are used to debugging might feel like all of this overhead would simply vanish by attaching a debugger and inspecting the state at specific points in the program. While this is certainly true, there are benefits and drawbacks to both approach. The biggest gain from dynamic analysis is itssimplicity of use, but it also suffers from being easily detected and made tedious by moden malware.</p>
<p>The table below shows some of the pros and cons for both analysis techniques.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Comparison of static and dynamic analysis pros and cons" src="img/d6dac52a64eb92f3.png"></p>
<p>Despite code evaluation being considered a good thing for dynamic analysis as it makes inspecting state a lot easier, it can also be a major risk when performing malware analysis, since the malicious code will be running and infecting the system in which analysis runs.</p>
<p>Static analysis has the added benefit that any modifications (such as statically unpacking or instrumenting a sample) means that the file is permanently altered, whereas a dynamic instrumentation would have to perform the steps for every new binary instance.</p>
<p>In practice, a mix of both types of analysis is often used according to what is faster or easier in the context of the reverse engineering effort, or what the analyst&#39;s preferences are.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Besides obfuscation, the sample in this workshop does not perform any anti-dynamic-analysis tricks, and motivated participants are encouraged to attempt the exercises through dynamic methods on their own, if only to compare the two approaches.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Identifying Types of Obfuscation" duration="15">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>In this step, we will explore various obfuscation techniques and the reasons behind obfuscation. You will learn the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What various obfuscation techniques look like</li>
<li>Motivation and goals of obfuscation</li>
<li>Identifying obfuscated code</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Why Obfuscate?</h2>
<p>There are multiple reasons to obfuscate code: The most common one is Digital Rights Management (DRM). A good example of this would be obfuscating license validation code to make it more difficult for crackers to bypass license checks or forge master licenses. Another very big area for obfuscation is anti-cheat software, which is becoming more and more prevalent with the rise of E-Sports and tournaments with ever-increasing cash prizes and big business models surrounding them.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also more dubious reasons, such as hiding malicious behavior from the prying eyes of incident responders and evading anti-viruses or sandboxes.</p>
<p>Obfuscation&#39;s primary goal is making an analyst&#39;s job difficult. Computers are good at executing a lot of instructions very quickly, and so obfuscation generally abuses this fact by taking simple, compiler optimized code and <strong>de-optimizing</strong> so that it becomes difficult for a human analyst to understand at the cost of more computations by the CPU.</p>
<p>All of these techniques are often combined and layered in passes to achieve arbitrary levels of complexity.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>The obfuscation wins if one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The analyst runs out of time to investigate</li>
<li>The analyst gives up because of frustration</li>
<li>The program is superseded before its obfuscation is broken</li>
</ul>
</aside>
<p>There are many different types of obfuscation and this section aims to present the most commonly seen form of obfuscations so that you can identify them if you run across them in the wild. Each technique is explained conceptually and when possible a simple example is shown to help visualize the transformations that occur.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Obfuscation is never unbreakable, but it is successful when the time requirement to break it outweighs the benefits of breaking it.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Junk Code Insertion</h2>
<p>The actual instructions are interleaved with code that does not affect the outcome of the instructions. This is a basic technique which can be easily defeated when used on its own, but it is often enough to fool less experienced analysts. This technique becomes useful when combined with opaque predicates and metamorphic code.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Junk insertion" src="img/cc5ac2e806cd2b62.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Metamorphic Code</h2>
<p>Metamorphic code is a technique which consists of expanding an instruction into a series of convoluted steps that yield the same result. It is an overarching theme of obfuscation and is at the core of several other techniques.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Metamorphic Code" src="img/efa49547f45c2d7e.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Data Encoding</h2>
<p>Arithmetic operations and literal values are expanded in multiple obtuse computations that are equivalent to the original. This applies to strings as well by performing temporarily computing the decoded string for the duration of a call where it is required, and then wiping or re-encoding that memory after the call returns.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Data Encoding" src="img/de138c9f51bad4b5.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Opaque Predicates</h2>
<p>Branches with a static outcome (i.e. always taken or never taken) are inserted in the code and the computation of the branch predicate is itself obfuscated. This technique explodes the code&#39;s cyclomatic complexity, and makes most decompilers generate horrible looking code.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Opaque Predicate Insertion" src="img/c38e39a5a77fcbb3.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Splitting</h2>
<p>Functions or basic blocks are split into smaller functions or blocks with unconditional jumps, calls, or opaque predicates and interleaved across the image, making it difficult for a human to keep track of the context/state of the function as it becomes impossible or very difficult to have a full-picture view of the code.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Block Splitting" src="img/538987fe05f9ef16.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p>When splitting, code is often scrambled or randomized to make the function less linear to the human eye.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Control Flow Flattening</h2>
<p>Transforms the logic flow of a function into a state machine which loops over the state and flattens all paths into a single dispatch table based on the state. Each branch updates the state according to the next branch. Flattening is similar in appearance to virtualization with the exception that there is no bytecode being interpreted.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Control Flow Flattening" src="img/350577af599d101d.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Virtualization</h2>
<p>Virtualization is among the most recent advancements in obfuscation. It works by converting the native code into a dynamically generated, unique bytecode with a matching interpreter loop. The function call is then replaced with an entry point to the virtual machine with a pointer to the bytecode stream to run.</p>
<p>This is one of the more difficult techniques to break.</p>
<p>The control flow graph will look almost identical to a control-flow-flattened function but with the addition that instead of embedding the state into the function itself, a run of bytecode is loaded and processed by the interpreter.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Polymorphic Code</strong></h2>
<p>Code that modifies itself during execution, altering what it does or the path it takes on subsequent executions, or even during the same execution. This technique can be very hard to analyse but requires writable and executable memory (or calls to memory protection APIs) which makes it detectable.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>To give a taste of the power of polymorphic code, consider a virtualized function interpreter which has an operation (opcode) which remaps the existing opcodes halfway through a bytecode run.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>But Wait, there&#39;s More!</h2>
<p>These are commonly used techniques, but finding obfuscation techniques is an area of research in its own right, so expect to find new and fascinating techniques to analyse in the wild.</p>
<p>Now that we have a grasp of what obfuscation is and what common techniques exist, it&#39;s time to dive into the first lab, where you&#39;ll analyze the mysterious sample</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="LAB 1: Analyzing the Stager" duration="20">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>In this step, you will go over the sample&#39;s code in Ghidra, identify the high level functionality of the program, identify the obstacles and determine a specific goal. By the end of this step you will have learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Ghidra to annotate functions and structures</li>
<li>Inspect Call Graphs and navigate cross references</li>
<li>Use the graph view, decompiler and assembly listings</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Identifying the Program Entry Point</h2>
<p>Moving back to Ghidra, you should have your <code>aba</code> project open with the auto-analysis complete from the previous step. Let&#39;s start by locating the entrypoint of the program. As you may know, the <code>main</code> symbol is the first function that gets called when your program start, but while this is true from your program&#39;s perspective, it is not entirely accurate from the operating system&#39;s perspective.</p>
<p>The ELF format has a field called <code>entry</code> which contains the location of the first function to call when the program starts. The operating system&#39;s <strong>loader</strong> will load the program&#39;s executable image in memory, initialize external libraries, create the main execution thread and finally move execution to the location specified by <code>entry</code> once all of this work is done.</p>
<p>The compiler usually sets <code>entry</code> to a generated function that performs common start up tasks such as initialize the runtime structures, process arguments and environment flags and so on, and this is the function that will eventually call your <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that the program&#39;s <code>main</code> might not be immediately visible, as symbol names are often stripped.</p>
<p>Going through the symbol tree of the sample, there is indeed no <code>main</code> to be found, so instead we start from <code>entry</code> and work our way through the initialization function until we identify the original main function.</p>
<p>With ELFs that link against LIBC, main will usually call an external function, <code>__libc_start_main</code> which looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>int __libc_start_main(int *(main)(int, char**, char**), // Address of main
                      int argc, char** ubp_av,          // Argument count and Argument values pointer
                      void (*init) (void),              // .init function pointer
                      void (*fini) (void),              // .fini function pointer
                      void (*rtld_fini) (void),         // .fini function for the dynamic loader
                      void (* stack_end));              // pointer to the end of the main thread stack.
</code></pre>
<p>This essentially means that once we find this function call, the first argument (which will be stored in <code>rdi</code> according to the Linux x64 calling convention) is the address of main. Following this address gives us the main function.</p>
<iframe class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO0PP9Gngz4?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<aside class="warning"><p>For custom built (or <code>--nolibc</code>) and heavily obfuscated binaries, it is possible that the entrypoint is not <code>__libc_start_main</code>, in those cases, starting from entry and treating it like main is usually fine even if slightly more time consuming.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Analyzing the Main Function</h2>
<p>Before we get started, here are a few hotkeys to keep in mind if you&#39;re more of a keyboard person:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L</strong> Rename Label / Function</li>
<li><strong>;</strong> Add Comment</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> Goto Address / Label / Expression</li>
<li><strong>C</strong> Clear Code at location</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> Disassembly at location</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve identified main, it&#39;s a good idea to name it so that it&#39;s easier to navigate to it later. In Ghidra, renaming works differently for labels and function names, but they both share the same hotkey of <code>L</code> for &#34;Label&#34;, otherwise <strong>right click</strong> and select <strong>Edit Label...</strong> or <strong>Functions &gt; Rename Function</strong> depending on whether Ghidra&#39;s analysis has identified your function.</p>
<p>Now type <code>main</code> and hit enter to confirm.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>When reversing, it&#39;s important to keep the bigger picture in mind as it&#39;s extremely easy to get lost in an endless rabbit hole of function calls. Instead of trying to understand each individual instruction, consider looking at the bigger picture of a function with the Graph View and by focusing on the entry and exit points of the function. Outgoing calls also give some high level knowledge of what a function is doing. These skills are very intuition based and will come naturally as you spend more time reversing and analyzing code.</p>

<p>The main function appears to call a few functions in turn, but before diving into any of them, let&#39;s scroll through the graph view and get an idea of what it&#39;s doing.</p>
<iframe class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKXHGR9T64E?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The function itself is linear and makes a few interesting calls:</p>
<pre><code>main:
;; ...
001029a1  CALL     FUN_00102be3
;; ...
001029d8  CALL     malloc
00102a08  CALL     rand
00102a15  CALL     malloc
00102a70  CALL     rand
00102a7d  CALL     malloc
;;  ...
00102b00  LEA      RDI,[DAT_001084c0] ; &#34;Advanced Binary Analysis Workshop&#34;
00102b07  CALL     puts
00102b0c  LEA      RDI,[DAT_0010ad40]
00102b13  CALL     FUN_001013de
;; ...
00102b18  MOV      ESI,0x333b7d02
00102b1d  MOV      EDI,0xcff72411

00102b60  LEAVE
00102b61  RET
</code></pre>
<p>Stripping out all the noise and focusing only on the calls, the function appears to perform some initialization (<code>FUN_00102be3</code>), then allocates some memory and makes some calls to <code>rand()</code> to get some random data, and then prints a banner that reads &#34;Advanced Binary Analysis&#34;.</p>
<p>Next, it calls <code>FUN_001013de</code> with a pointer to some global data as its single argument.</p>
<p>Following that, two calls to <code>FUN_001012fb</code> which takes two hardcoded constants, are made and the first call&#39;s return value (in <code>RAX</code>) is stored in <code>RDX</code>. The second call&#39;s return value is then passed as an argument to <code>CALL RDX</code>, hinting that <code>RDX</code> is a function pointer.</p>
<p>At this point, there is enough information to start guessing at what is going on here. It&#39;s a good idea to incrementally review the names you assign to functions and labels, as your understanding of the program becomes clearer. A first pass could realistically make the following renames:</p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Symbol</strong></p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>New Name</strong></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>FUN_00102be3</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>maybe_init</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>DAT_0010ad40</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>main_data</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>FUN_001012fb</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>maybe_process_consts</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>FUN_001013de</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>maybe_process_data</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>It&#39;s very important to have a naming system in place that reflects the level of certainty in your annotations, and every analyst will have their own preference when it comes to that. A simple system that works for getting started is adding a prefix such as <code>maybe_</code>, <code>wip_</code>, and <code>todo_</code> to represent the analysis state of a function.</p>
<p>Another idea might be to use a confidence indicator (<code>0-100</code>) as a suffix. Experience will help you find what suits you best. On collaborative projects, some analysts like namespacing their symbols with their username as well because it makes it easier to find who to ask questions about a particular piece of code.</p>
<p>As an analyst, you have the choice of what to analyze next. Functions tend to lead to even more choices, so it&#39;s a good idea to check data first, as it&#39;s usually quick and may yield some interesting knowledge.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Static Analysis is an iterative process in which each piece of knowledge provides a small part of the bigger picture, so revisiting your assumptions and knowledge frequently is key to making progress. Make it a habit to review your work and notes when working on large projects.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Analyzing <code>DAT_0010ad40</code> (main_data)</h2>
<p>We start our analysis by jumping to <code>DAT_0010ad40</code>. You can do this by clicking on the label and hitting the <strong>Enter</strong> key on your keyboard. We are greeted with a lot of uninitialized data and cross references. To be specific, there appears to be one cross-reference per byte of data, all of which are coming from a single function: <code>FUN_00102C54</code>. Following the XREF, the function appears to do nothing but move bytes into <code>main_data</code>. Definitely some kind of initialization function, and to confirm, our suspicions, the incoming call to this data moving function (which we can rename to <code>init_main_data</code>) appears to be from <code>maybe_init</code>.</p>
<iframe class="youtube-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuuYZXD6vnY?rel=0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>We can safely rename <code>maybe_init</code> to <code>init</code>, now that we know what it&#39;s doing.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Analyzing <code>FUN_001012fb</code> (maybe_process_consts)</h2>
<p>Next we analyze the function which is processing constants since it is called by both <code>main</code> and <code>process_data</code>. The reasoning behind this choice is that understanding what this function does will help us understand what the other functions are doing.</p>
<p>Upon first inspection, this function has a little bit more complexity than the previous. We take a quick look at the graph and observe two loops which appear to be nested into one another. The decompilation view shows that a variable called <code>local_28</code> is assigned data from <code>DAT_0010ad20</code>. Given the accesses that we see to this <code>local_28</code> variable, we can guess that it is a pointer some kind of structure and the expressions in the form of <code>*(cast*)local_28 + offset)</code> are field accesses.</p>
<p>The biggest offset access seems to be at offset <code>0x20</code>, for an 8 byte pointer which is dereferenced and assigned to <code>local_28</code>, telling is that this is some sort of linked list.</p>
<pre><code>// Classical linked list traversal.
struct node_t* node = list_head;
while (node-&gt;next) {
  node = node-&gt;next;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We&#39;ll create a custom data type for it using Ghidra&#39;s type manager and give it a size of <code>0x28</code> and name the field at offset 0x20 <code>next</code>.</p>
<p>First, find the data type manager window at the bottom left of the Code Browser and <strong>right click</strong> on <code>aba</code>, then select <strong>New &gt; Structure...</strong>. Then type <code>0x28</code> in the size box and hit <strong>Tab</strong> for the structure editor to refresh. Name the structure something meaningful (for instance <code>const_struct1</code>).</p>
<aside class="special"><p>It helps to set the offset display to hexadecimal from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner of the window.</p>
</aside>
<p>Next, find offset <code>0x20</code>, change its data type to <code>void*</code> and rename it to <code>next</code>. After saving the structure, go back to the decompilation view and retype the <code>local_28</code> variable (shortcut <code>Ctrl+L</code>) to <code>const_struct1*</code>. Notice that the reference to <code>local_28-&gt;next</code> immediately appears, making the code a lot easier to read.</p>

<p>After repeating this exercise a few times and end up with the following code listing:</p>
<pre><code>void * find_from_consts(uint const1,uint const2)

{
  void **auxiliary_res;
  const_struct1 *list1;
  const_struct2 *list2;
  void *retval;

  list1 = global_list;
  while ((list1 != (const_struct1 *)0x0 &amp;&amp; (const1 != list1-&gt;hash))) {
    list1 = list1-&gt;next;
  }
  if (list1 == (const_struct1 *)0x0) {
    retval = (void *)0x0;
  }
  else {
    list2 = list1-&gt;sublist;
    while ((list2 != (const_struct2 *)0x0 &amp;&amp; (const2 != list2-&gt;hash))) {
      list2 = list2-&gt;next;
    }
    if (list2 == (const_struct2 *)0x0) {
      if (list1-&gt;unk_ptr == (void *)0x0) {
        retval = (void *)0x0;
      }
      else {
                    /* If the pointer is set, call an alternative search function */
        auxiliary_res = (void **)maybe_extended_find(list1,(ulong)const2,(ulong)const2);
        if (auxiliary_res == (void **)0x0) {
          retval = (void *)0x0;
        }
        else {
          retval = *auxiliary_res;
        }
      }
    }
    else {
      retval = list2-&gt;value;
    }
  }
  return retval;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is starting to look like some kind of lookup function based on hashes, so we can rename it <code>find_from_consts</code>. In the process, we&#39;ve also recovered partial structure information</p>
<pre><code>typedef unsigned char   undefined;

typedef unsigned char    byte;
typedef unsigned char    dwfenc;
typedef unsigned int    dword;
typedef unsigned long    qword;
typedef unsigned int    uint;

typedef unsigned char    undefined1;
typedef unsigned int    undefined4;
typedef unsigned long    undefined8;
typedef unsigned short    word;
typedef struct const_struct1 const_struct1, *Pconst_struct1;
typedef struct const_struct2 const_struct2, *Pconst_struct2;

struct const_struct1 {
    undefined field_0x0[8];
    uint hash; /* Created by retype action */
    undefined field_0xc[4];
    void * unk_ptr; /* Created by retype action */
    struct const_struct2 * sublist; /* Created by retype action */
    struct const_struct1 * next;
};

struct const_struct2 {
    void * value;
    uint hash; /* Created by retype action */
    undefined field_0xc[4];
    struct const_struct2 * next;
    undefined field_0x18[8];
};
</code></pre>
<p>We have a good idea what this function does now, but it would be helpful to know where that list comes from... unfortunately, we do not have the necessary information (yet) to answer that, and so this question can be put on a list of auxiliary goals.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Analyzing <code>FUN_001013de</code> (maybe_process_data)</h2>
<p>Next, we peek into <code>maybe_process_data</code> and are greeted by a very messy-looking function. In fact, it is so messy that even Ghidra&#39;s graph view is complaining and saying that it can&#39;t render it properly. Oh boy.</p>
<p>The only thing we know for sure at this point is that the <code>main_data</code> buffer is passed as an argument to this function. The rest is hidden in what looks like a big switch case.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Ghidra’s graph view failing" src="img/fd16b5906ef566b1.png"></p>
<p>We&#39;ll rely on a different feature of Ghidra to get a preliminary idea of what this function is doing, the call tree. To open it, click on the diagonal green arrow button next to the purple checkmark. This view displays cross-references as a list of inbound functions (functions calling this <code>maybe_process_data</code>) and outbound function calls (functions called by <code>maybe_process_data</code>). It is recursive, so if you expand one of the called functions, it will show you what functions are called from there, and so on.</p>
<p>This view gives a general idea of the code flow to and from the function under analysis.</p>

<p>The call to uncompress is a good indicator that this data is compressed somehow, but it doesn&#39;t look like a valid archive format, so in all likelyhood it is also encrypted, and this function (or one of the functions it calls) is responsible for decompressing it.</p>
<p>Analyzing this function looks like a very daunting task though, so instead, we will let the code itself do the hard work for us.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Summary</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve gone through a few of the core functions of the sample, and now have a very good idea of what the functionality is, but there are still a few unanswered questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this large chunk of data in <code>main_data</code> and what is <code>maybe_process_data</code> doing with it?</li>
<li>How is the <code>global_list</code> of <code>const_struct1</code> populated?</li>
<li>What even is <code>const_struct1</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these questions can be answered by diving further into the call tree and analyzing more functions. We will focus on answering the first question in the next lab. The other two are left as optional exercises, but the remaining labs may give you a good idea.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>OPTIONAL</strong> There is one function that we did not analyze that will be useful for lab 3. Can you figure out what the function <code>FUN_00101209</code> does?</p>
</aside>
<p>In the next lab, we will write an emulator to analyse the obfuscated function.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="LAB 2: Unpacking the Nested Payload" duration="45">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>In this step, you will build an emulator from the ground up by using LIEF and Unicorn Engine, once the emulator is complete, you will be able to use it to extract the packed payload without having to analyze and understand what the unpacking routine is doing. By the end of this step, you will have learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using LIEF to parse executable file formats</li>
<li>Using Unicorn Engine to emulate code</li>
<li>Building custom tools on top of Unicorn Engine</li>
<li>Altering the emulated CPU state dynamically</li>
<li>Stubbing out external functions</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>The code in this section is available as a Jupyter Notebook <code>labs.ipynb</code> from the docker image (either self-hosted docker or the online shared workshop) for you to follow interactively. It&#39;s also possible to recode it from scratch if you wish. In the Jupyter UI, you can choose <code>Run &gt; Run All Cells</code> to perform all steps in the lab at once, or you can run each step manually. It is recommended to only run a cell once you have read and understood what it does.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Ground Work</h2>
<p>In this section we will be manipulating binary files and doing a lot of low level legwork to get the emulator working. First, we import a number of modules that come in handy most of the time when dealing with binary formats.</p>
<pre><code>import lief                       # Executable format parsing
from unicorn import *             # Unicorn emulation engine
from unicorn.x86_const import *   # Unicorn X86 and X64 constants.
from struct import pack, unpack   # Packing / Unpacking
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we define a few interesting addresses extracted from the program analysis performed in Ghidra</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: RVA stands for relative virtual address and represents an offset from the base of the image. The virtual address (VA) is computed as</p>
<pre><code>VA = BASE + RVA
</code></pre>
<p>Which addresses are relative and absolute can quickly become confusing, so it&#39;s a good idea to pick one approach (here, <code>BASE+RVA</code>) and stick to it. It also helps to label variables with <code>RVA</code> and <code>VA</code> accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>BASE           = 0x00100000  # The base address of the executable
PACKED_RVA     = 0x0000AD40  # The offset of the packed bytes buffer
MAIN_RVA       = 0x0000298E  # The offset of the main function
UNPACK_RVA     = 0x000013D0  # The offset of the unpacking function

AFTER_INIT_RVA = 0x000029A6  # The offset immediately after `init` has returned
LOOKUP_RVA     = 0x000012FB  # The offset of the symbol lookup routine
PACKED_SIZE    =       2497  # Size of the packed bytes buffer

START_RVA      = MAIN_RVA    # THe offset to start emulation at
STOP_RVA       = 0x00002B18  # The offsett to end emulation at

PAGE_SIZE      = 0x1000      # The size of a memory page.

# Load the sample using LIEF
ELF = lief.parse(&#39;bin/aba&#39;)
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Extending Unicorn</h2>
<p>By itself, Unicorn doesn&#39;t go beyond emulating a CPU and running instructions. What this means is that in order to do anything more complex than emulating shellcode, the analyst is responsible for providing all of the platform and operating system functionality that normal programs rely on to function.</p>
<p>We will build an emulator class that wraps Unicorn and adds basic tracing capability for debugging and support for stubbing out addresses or external symbol.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that LIEF is a binary format parser and not a loader. That is to say, the executable data will be in an unmapped format. What this means is that our code will have to handle several loader tasks such as <code>BSS</code> expansion, segment mapping, and relocations.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Unicorn can only map memory in <code>PAGE_SIZE</code> increments and on page boundaries, which is usually <code>0x1000</code>, and will throw an <code>UC_ERR_ARG</code> if you try to map non-page-sized or unaligned memory.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This class is quite a handful, but it only has two methods that do anything complicated. Let&#39;s break them down one at a time.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Breakdown of <code>Emulator.__init__</code></h3>
<p>This method is responsible for creating the emulator wrapper. It can be thought of as a simplified loader. Going through the numbered code blocks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First the method defines some variables which will be used to trace the instruction history, the registered function stubs, and the symbols that are imported by the sample.</li>
<li>A chunk of memory is mapped to the emulator&#39;s state for the stack. The registers <code>rbp</code> and <code>rsp</code> are set to point at the top of the stack, because the stack grows downwards (Allocating space by calling <code>sub rsp, &lt;space&gt;;</code>)</li>
<li>We perform the job that the ELF loader would do by calculating the total memory size required to map the code and data segments of the sample into memory, then map that memory for Unicorn and copy (<code>uc.mem_write</code>) the bytes into the mapped memory.</li>
<li>We continue performing the loader&#39;s job by walking through the relocation entries and identifying those which are for external symbols (<code>reloc.has_symbol</code>). When they do, we perform the relocation and store the imported symbol name in <code>self.imports</code>. Since we are not loading the external libraries, this is necessary to detect calls into external code and stop the emulator if the call is not handled by our script.</li>
<li>Hooks are registered with Unicorn so that it calls our wrapper on every single instruction and whenever an access to unmapped memory (segmentation fault) occurs. The latter is handled by dumping out recently emulated instruction adddresses for manual investigation, and the former is handled by the <code>_on_rip_updated_method</code> which will be broken down next.</li>
<li>This is necessary because Linux stores the stack cookie at <code>FS:[0x28]</code> which needs to be mapped. We map the first page of memory (<code>0000 - 1000</code>) to avoid segmentation faults.</li>
</ol>
<h3 is-upgraded>Breakdown of <code>Emulator._on_rip_updated</code></h3>
<p>This method is called on every instruction pointer update and is responsible for the bulk of added functionality. It performs instruction history tracking, as well as stubbed address lookups and dispatching.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the history by keeping the last 10 instruction addresses that have executed.</li>
<li>Stub lookup and dispatch. If the address is an imported symbol and doesn&#39;t have an associated stub, then execution cannot continue, so print an error and stop emulating. Otherwise, if the address has an associated stub, call the stub and clean up the stack by simulating a <code>ret</code> instruction (<code>mov rip, [rsp]; add rsp, 8</code>), thus returning code execution to the calling function and skipping the stubbed function code.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Stubbing External Functions</h2>
<p>This is all well and good, but if you were to try to run the emulation right now, the very first thing that you would get is the error message:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: Imported function called without a stub: malloc
</code></pre>
<p>This makes sense because looking back at <code>main</code>, it does indeed start with a <code>malloc</code>, followed by a <code>rand</code>. There is no good way to know if ths initialization is important, so we ought to stub as much as possible.</p>
<p>This can be a very tedious process, and having good instrumentation is important to properly identify external calls. Some samples obfuscate external calls as well, meaning that the approach shown here might not always work. In general, the cycle for stubbing out a function can be described in 3 steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lookup the function signature and documentation</li>
<li>Implement the side effects in the host script</li>
<li>Test that the emulated code makes it past the stub.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is repeated over and over, until enough external calls are stubbed for the emulation to proceed to the desired point.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Stubbing can be used for complex functions that take time to emulate, when a native implementation can be used instead (e.g. <code>md5</code>, <code>sha1</code>,  <code>zlib</code>, and more)</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The code should be straightforward as it is only implementing the functions by modifying the CPU and memory state of the emulator. We will work through the example of how <code>memcpy</code> was stubbed, as the principle can be generalized to all stubs.</p>
<p>First, we look at the manual entry for <code>memcpy</code>, more specifically the function signature, its return value, and what its side effects are.</p>
<pre><code>$ man memcpy
NAME
       memcpy - copy memory area

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.  The memory areas must not overlap.
       Use memmove(3) if the memory areas do overlap.

RETURN VALUE
       The memcpy() function returns a pointer to dest.
</code></pre>
<p>To implement this, we&#39;ll need to read <code>n</code> bytes from <code>src</code> and write them to <code>dst</code>. Then we must return <code>dst</code>. In x64 Linux, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions" target="_blank">calling convention</a> for the first 6 arguments is <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, <code>rdx</code>, <code>rcx</code>, <code>r8</code> and <code>r9</code>. The return value is in <code>rax</code>. This should be enough for most function stubs.</p>
<p>So we first read the register values of <code>rdi</code>, <code>rsi</code>, and <code>rdx</code> using <code>uc.reg_read</code>, then we read <code>rdx</code> bytes from the address in <code>rsi</code> using <code>uc.mem_read</code> and write them into the address at <code>rdi</code> using <code>uc.mem_write</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we set <code>rax</code> to the value of <code>rdi</code>, which is the destination buffer, using <code>uc.reg_write</code>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all. Now our function stub will alter the CPU and memory state in the same way as the real memcpy would.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Optional: Implement a stub for <code>free</code> so that it removes the block from the heap chunks. Do not worry about heap implementation details such as free lists and memory reuse.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Quickly Finding Functions to Stub</h2>

</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Putting it all Together</h2>
<p>We&#39;re almost ready to unpack this payload! The last thing to do is to stub <code>lookup</code> which we know will fail since no library is loaded.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous lab, lookup takes two unsigned 32 bit integers and returns a pointer to the symbol or function, as a way to hide which functions the packed module actually calls. We&#39;ll take advantage of that to build &#34;fake&#34; pointers which contain the module hash in the upper 32 bits and the symbol hash in the lower 32 bits.</p>
<p>If our theory that the payload is going to store the resolved symbol addresses somewhere is correct, then the unpacked data will contain the <code>(module, symbol)</code> combination &#34;pointer&#34; in its data whereever it would have stored the real pointer.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if the payload makes any calls during unpacking using these symbols, we will get a segfault at the instruction corresponding to <code>(module. symbol)</code>. This is win-win for us.</p>
<pre><code>def lookup(uc, address):
    module = uc.reg_read(UC_X86_REG_RDI)
    symbol = uc.reg_read(UC_X86_REG_RSI)
    print(f&#39;Lookup module={module:08X} symbol={symbol:08X}&#39;)
    addr = (module &lt;&lt; 32) | symbol
    uc.reg_write(UC_X86_REG_RAX, addr)
</code></pre>
<p>At last, we can create our emulator and run it. On the first attempt, we end up with output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>...
Lookup module=4B621F2A symbol=45A45044
...
Lookup module=CFF72411 symbol=75F258D3
Segmentation Fault! rip=CFF7241175F258D3 &lt;--- That&#39;s a (module, symbol) tuple.
    Most Recent Instructions:
    #00    0000000000102540
    #01    000000000010253B
    #02    0000000000102534
    #03    000000000010252D

    #09    0000000000102509
    #10    0000000000102502
</code></pre>
<p>And as expected, it looks like the sample called into a resolved symbol. Unfortunately, to be able to retrieve the unpacked code, we need to either do some complicated acrobatics in Unicorn hooks, or have the emulation end without crashing. Fortunately, the history shows that the last instruction that executed before the segmentation fault was at <code>0x102540</code>... That&#39;s in the <code>unpack</code> function, more specifically:</p>
<pre><code>0010252d   48 81 c3 50 02 00 00       ADD      RBX,0x250
00102534   48 8b 85 28 fc ff ff       MOV      RAX,qword ptr [local_3e0 + RBP]
0010253b   bf ef be ad d3             MOV      EDI,0xd3adbeef
00102540   ff d0                      CALL     RAX
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s reasonable to assume that if the sample is calling a resolved symbol, the unpacking must be complete, so we&#39;ll tentatively set the <code>STOP_RVA</code> to the instruction immediately before the crash.</p>
<pre><code>STOP_RVA = 0x2540  # Comment out to experience the segmentation fault described above.

# Create the unicorn wrapper with the sample.

<p>Interestingly, our stub for <code>dlopen</code> shows that 3 external libraries are being loaded during the unpacking. This is a strong indicator for what the packed payload might attempt to do:</p>
<pre><code>dlopen lib=libc.so.6
dlopen lib=libcurl.so.4
dlopen lib=libpthread.so.0
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the unpacked data in <code>bin/unpacked.bin</code>, it&#39;s time to map it into Ghidra and give the analysis a spin. If it unpacked properly, Ghidra should detect some valid x86 code that makes sense.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Mapping a raw binary file into Ghidra</h2>
<p>In Ghidra, select <strong>File &gt; Add to Program...</strong> and navigate to <code>unpacked.bin</code>. Next, click on options and change the base address to something nice and out of the way, like <code>0042000000</code>, and give it a meaningful block name, like <code>unpacked</code>. Navigate to the <strong>Program Tree</strong> and select <code>unpacked</code>, then go to the menu and select <strong>Analysis &gt; Auto Analyze ‘aba&#39; ...</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>Great! All that&#39;s missing now is to figure out what the <code>(module, symbol)</code> tuples are mapped to, and we&#39;ll be able to start analyzing the payload!</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="LAB 3: Unpacked Payload Analysis" duration="45">
        <p>The hardest part is out of the way! Now that you have the unpacked payload ready for analysis, the final straight is in sight.

<p>This code snippet might take a while to run, because it will open the libraries locally using LIEF and process each library&#39;s exported symbols, computing the hash and adding it to a global dictionary.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Depending on your operating system, your local libraries might not be located at any of the paths in <code>LOCATIONS</code>, in which case you will need to modify the code above.</p>
</aside>
<p>The code first allocates a page of memory where it then writes a symbol name, and calls the <code>hash</code> wrapper function, which is a stub that sets up the emulator to run the real hash function by populating the <code>rdi</code> and <code>rsi</code> registers with the allocated buffer address and the length of the symbol to hash. The return value is then taken from <code>rax</code> and returned.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Creating a Ghidra Script to Resolve Hashes</h2>
<p>In the previous lab, we had output the module and symbol hash as the resolved address, following up on that, we will now write a Ghidra script that takes 8 bytes at the memory cursor, and if they resolve to a hash in the hash dictionary we built, labels the address with the original symbol name.</p>
<p>First, open the Ghidra Script editor and create a new script by pressing on the <strong>Create Script</strong> button and selecting Python. Give it a sensible name such as <code>resolve.py</code> and write the following script:</p>

<aside class="warning"><p>Make sure to edit <code>HASHES</code> to point to your own <code>hashes.json</code> dictionary, otherwise the script will not work.</p>
</aside>
<p>With that in place, it&#39;s time to locate some of the resolved symbols and test the reverse hash lookup.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Reverse Hash Lookup</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start by locating one of the hashes that the unpacker script dumped. Select <strong>Search &gt; Memory... (S)</strong> from the Ghidra Menu and make sure that the format is set to <strong>Hex</strong>. Grab any of the hashes from the unpacker output (<code>4B621F2A</code> will do) and type it in the <strong>Search Value</strong> box. After hitting search you should find a number of results from the <code>unpacked</code> segment. Navigate to any result and let&#39;s try the hash lookup function.</p>
<p>Ghidra has already detected cross refefenreces to this address, making it easy to identify which bytes are the full hash. The script we wrote expects a QWORD, so let&#39;s right click on the address, and select <strong>Data &gt; qword</strong>. Now the listing should look like:</p>
<pre><code>                  QWORD_42004048                        XREF[1]:  FUN_42001090:42001090
42004048 09 ad 85 c4 11 24 f7 cf    dq       CFF72411C485AD09h
</code></pre>
<p>All that&#39;s left to do is run the script by selecting the QWORD and clicking the <strong>Run</strong> button from the script&#39;s code listing. Subsequent runs can be repeated with the shortcut <strong>Ctrl + Shift + R</strong>.</p>
<p>After running the script, we get the following output and a label is added to our listing. Hoorah!</p>

<p>The <code>localhost:3000</code> URL immediately sticks out and raises a &#34;suspicious&#34; flag. The rest of the function looks like it has some overarching logic and calls into a bunch of other functions. We&#39;ll start by drilling down each function to hope that it will eventually call one of the hashed symbols which we have looked up. The first such call is to the function <code>FUN_4200110</code>, which has a very short listing:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This sure looks ike it has some malicious functionality. The decompiled code is not that pretty, but it&#39;s enough to give us a good idea of what is going on. Let&#39;s walk through it step by step.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A buffer of 4096 bytes is allocated to receive data into.</li>
<li>Curl is configured to perform a request to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, with the buffer as an argument and a function which, when reading through the curl documentation, turns out to be a write callback which will flush the HTTP response bytes into the buffer. Reading the manual here saves considerable time reversing <code>FUN_42001754</code>.</li>
<li>The first 4 bytes of the buffer are read and transformed with a very unsightly combination of bitshifts and bitflips. This is presumably some form of encryption or protection to obfuscate the real opcode.</li>
<li>Once decoded, the opcode is checked against some 32 bit values which turn out to be symbol hashes that use the same algorithm as the imported symbols, so they can also be looked up and identified. The right operation is performed according to this opcode. There appear to be 4 operations:<ul>
<li>Sleep</li>
<li>System call</li>
<li>Run Shellcode</li>
<li>Exit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the hash matches <code>exit</code>, then the variable <code>bVar3</code> is set to true, and subsequently used to post a semaphore and then exit the dispatch loop. We haven&#39;t seen where this semaphore is being used, but recall previously that the sample program was also performing some symbol lookups, so it&#39;s a safe guess that the host will be waiting on that semaphore before terminating the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now have all of the necessary information to build a kill-switch for this sample.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Solving the Kill-Switch Payload</h2>
<p>To enter the kill-switch code path, we need <code>opcode</code> to be equal to the value <code>0xaf03baa8</code>. The input (<code>oper</code>) is coming from the command and control server, so it is impossible to find that value in the code. We could either spend time trying to understand the transformations that are being made, or we could let the computer solve that for us.</p>
<p>Before diving into the implementation, let&#39;s determine which part of the method we need to execute. We want to assume that <code>oper</code> can be anything, and we want to trace execution until <code>opcode</code> is assigned, so right until the <code>if</code> statement at <strong>(4)</strong> in the code listing above.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s grab those memory offsets real quick... the start is right where <code>maybe_command</code> gets dereferenced and assigned to <code>oper</code> (at <strong>(3)</strong>), the corresponding assembly listing is</p>
<pre><code>                  get_oper                              XREF[1]:  420013e9(j)

</code></pre>
<p>At instruction <strong>(a)</strong>, the command buffer is dereferenced, this returns the pointer to the data (the buffer is a structure with a pointer to data and a size). Instruction <strong>(b)</strong> is then moving a double word (<code>uint32_t</code>) into EAX, which corresponds to the <code>oper = *maybe_command</code> line. From <strong>©</strong>, the decoding process is starting, so we will assign a symbolic value to the memory at <code>[RBP + maybe_command]</code> (think of it as an algebraic variable) and execute the code starting from <strong>(b)</strong> with <code>RAX</code> containing the address of <code>[RBP + maybe_command]</code>.</p>
<p>The start RVA is thus <code>0x13FB</code>.</p>
<p>For the stop offset, we need to identify the first instruction where <code>opcode</code> is fully computed, this corresponds to the assembly</p>
<pre><code> 420014d1 8b 45 ac                   MOV      EAX,dword ptr [RBP + opcode]

 420014d6 2d c5 f8 eb 54             SUB      EAX,0x54ebf8c5
 420014db 89 45 ac                   MOV      dword ptr [RBP + opcode],EAX ; (d)
</code></pre>
<p>At <strong>(d)</strong> where <code>EAX</code> is moved into the <code>RBP+opcode</code>, the value of <code>oper</code> is now the expected opcode to execute.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll use <code>0x14DB</code> as the stop offset.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start working on the symbolic execution script. First we&#39;ll import <code>angr</code> and define our start and stop offsets.</p>
<pre><code>import angr                   # Angr core module
from claripy import BVS, BVV  # Bitvectors for values and symbols


SYMBEX_START_RVA = 0x13FB  # Offset where we should start symbolic execution
SYMBEX_STOP_RVA  = 0x14DB  # Offset where we should end the symbolic execution
SYMBEX_OUTPUT_OFFSET = -0x54  # The Location on the stack where `opcode` is stored
SYMBEX_INPUT_OFFSET = -0x28

<aside class="special"><p>Here the importance of working with relative addresses becomes clear as the unpacked binary will not be mapped at the same base address in Angr.</p>
</aside>
<p>The first step will be to load the unpacked payload into Angr. Because our unpacked payload is not a valid ELF file, we will have to tell Angr to load it as a data blob. This will restrict a lot of the functionality that Angr offers (such as resolving imports, mapping external libraries, etc.) But is fine for our goal, since we want to target a specific code path</p>

<p>Next, we will setup the CPU state for Angr, assign symbols and symbolically execute the relevant portion of the function:</p>
<pre><code># (1) Initialize the internal CPU and memory state of angr for a function call
s0 = unpacked.factory.call_state(UNPACKED_BASE + SYMBEX_START_RVA, add_options=angr.options.simplification)
s0.regs.rbp = s0.regs.rsp  # stack has no data in it.

# (2) Create symbols to represent the input data and the resulting opcode.
sym_opcode = BVS(&#39;opcode&#39;, 32)
sym_input = BVS(&#39;input&#39;, 32)

# (3) Place the symbols in the angr memory state.
s0.mem[s0.regs.rbp + SYMBEX_OUTPUT_OFFSET].uint32_t = sym_opcode

# Arbitrarily pick 0x1000 as the allocated command buffer.
s0.mem[0x1000].uint32_t = sym_input
s0.regs.rax = 0x1000  # RAX holds a pointer to the command buffer.

# (4) Step through the symbolic execution until we find a block that comes after the stop offset.
sim = unpacked.factory.simgr(s0)
final = None
while not final and len(sim.active) &gt; 0:
    for s in sim.active:  # Go through each active state in the symbolic execution.
        print(f&#39;Executing block @ {s.addr:08X}&#39;)
        if s.addr &gt;= UNPACKED_BASE + SYMBEX_STOP_RVA:
            # The address of this block comes after our target stop address,
            # this means that at this CPU state, the opcode must have been
            # calculated.
            final = s
            break
    # Advance all active states by one basic-block.
    sim.step()

print(f&#39;Final block reached&#39;)

# Uncomment to print the abstract syntax tree representing the computation.
# print(final.mem[final.regs.rbp + SYMBEX_OUTPUT_OFFSET].uint32_t)

# (5) Ask Angr to solve the symbolic formula representing the relationship
#     between the calculated opcode and the input, assuming that the value is
#     the opcode for `exit`.
final.solver.add(sym_opcode == 0xaf03baa8)

# If the solver finds a valid answer, this result must be the input that yields
# the desired output (i.e. the command buffer that will result in the `exit` opcode
# being executed.)
killswitch = final.solver.eval(sym_input)

print(f&#39;Found kill switch encoded opcode: {killswitch:08X}&#39;)

# Dump the encoded opcode to disk. Remember that integers on X86 are
# little endian, so we pack it to get the right byte order.
with open(&#39;bin/killswitch.bin&#39;, &#39;wb&#39;) as out:
    out.write(pack(&#39;&lt;I&#39;, killswitch))

</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s all there is to it! This short snippet of code actually has a lot going on though, so let&#39;s walk through it step by step.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The code starts by creating a <code>call_state</code> at the start address of the code that we want to emulate. Angr provides several state factories which initialize various parts of the CPU. The <code>call_state</code> factory initializes a stack, sets the value of <code>RSP</code> and sets the values of any arguments in the registers and on the stack according to a calling convention. It also writes the return address on the stack, and leaves everything else uninitialized.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case we do not have any arguments and do not care about the return value, but this saves us from having to manually setup the state. We also set <code>RBP</code> to <code>RSP</code> so that the stack size is 0 and that code references to <code>[RBP + xxx]</code> will work on concrete values. This is necessary because the code that we want to execute addresses local variables on its stack relative to <code>RBP</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Two symbols are created to represent the input data (32 bits wide) and the resulting opcode. You can think of symbols as algebraic variables that can hold arbitrary values. Throughout the execution, the symbolic execution engine will compute the transformations on those symbols and build an abstract syntax tree (AST) which represents the behavior of the code on the symbols.</li>
<li>By themselves, the symbols won&#39;t achieve much, they must be placed in the memory state so that angr&#39;s engine encounters and uses the symbols in its execution. This code is placing the <code>opcode</code> symbol at the location in memory which we established stores the final opcode and the <code>input</code> symbol at an arbitrary memory address which will be used to represent the command and control&#39;s response buffer containing the command to execute. Because we start our code right after the memory address of that buffer has been put in RAX, the script directly puts the chosen address into RAX.</li>
<li>With the CPU and memory state ready for execution, the a simulation manager is created which will store the various possible next states. By default, branches will result in two states being created in the simulation, one where the branch is taken, and one where it isn&#39;t. The script simply loops through all possible states until the first state which starts on an instruction that happens after the expected end block is reached. This approach works for this specific case because the function  does not trample the local variables and is fairly linear. Some scenarios might require more complex state management.</li>
<li>With the final state found, the &#34;value&#34; at the memory location where the opcode would normally be is now an AST which represents all the transformations that have occurred to get from <code>input</code> to <code>opcode</code>. Just like a high school math problem, we plug the value of <code>x</code> (<code>x</code> being <code>opcode</code>, in this case) to the value we expect it to be, and ask Angr&#39;s solver engine to find <code>input</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Testing the Kill-Switch</h2>
<p>To prove to ourselves that all of this work is actually right, we finally (for the first time since the beginning of the workshop, think about that for a second) execute the sample on our real CPU with a local HTTP server that will serve <code>killswitch.bin</code> as its index.html on <code>localhost:3000</code>. If our calculations are right, the sample should exit immediately.</p>
<pre><code>cp bin/killswitch.bin index.html
python -m http.server 3000

./aba

        <h2 is-upgraded>The End</h2>
<p>Congratulations, if you&#39;ve made it this far, you&#39;ve hopefully learned a lot in a very short period of time. Give yourself a pat on the back and a chance to relax. These concepts are very low-level and need some time to properly sink in.</p>
<p>To give a quick retrospect of what you&#39;ve achieved throughout this workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial analysis of an unknown sample</li>
<li>Detecting obfuscation and devising an approach to cirucmvent it</li>
<li>Using code emulation to statically inspect subsets of a sample</li>
<li>Using function stubbing to abstract external call and method side effects</li>
<li>Modify CPU state dynamically during analysis to control execution flow</li>
<li>Blackbox methods using emulation to &#34;execute&#34; useful functions without having to understand/re-implement them</li>
<li>Script Ghidra to perform reverse hash lookup and label functions</li>
<li>Use Symbolic Execution to build an abstract representation of computations</li>
<li>Use Constraint Solving to query that representation and determine the input that yields the desired output</li>
</ul>
