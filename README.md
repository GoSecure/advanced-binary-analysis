## Install

This repository uses git LFS to store large files, make sure you have the `git-lfs` package installed, then run

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs checkout
```

to ensure that all the static assets are available.

## Usage

Serve `html/` with your favorite built-in HTTP server or navigate to the URL in the repository description.

```sh
cd html && python3 -m http.server 8080
firefox http://localhost:8080
```


Build and run the workshop environment:

```
# Build docker image
docker build -t advanced-binary-analysis .

# Create workshop container instance
docker run --name aba-workshop -v$(pwd):/home/lab -p 8888:8888 -it advanced-binary-analysis

```


After running the workshop, to clean up the environment:

```sh
# Remove docker container when done
docker stop aba-workshop && docker rm aba-workshop

# Remove docker image to reclaim disk space.
docker rmi advanced-binary-analysis
```


# Building Code Lab

If you modify the code lab sources (`advanced-binary-analysis.md`) you will need to re-export the HTML. This can be done using [claat][3]:

```sh
claat export advanced-binary-analysis.md
rm -rf html
mv advanced-binary-analysis html
```


Keep in mind that LAB 2 and LAB 3 are duplicated and slightly edited versions of `labs/labs.ipynb` to make use of Code Lab's info and warning outlines, so if you modify either, you should keep the Jupyter Notebook in sync.
